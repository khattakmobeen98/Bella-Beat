# Bella Beat Case Study

BACKGROUND
Bellabeat offers a diverse range of products, and for this case study, the focus will be on analyzing smart device data to understand how consumers are utilizing their devices. The insights derived from this analysis will inform the company’s marketing strategy moving forward.

Specifically, the analysis will center on the Bellabeat app and explore the relationship between users’ physical activity—particularly their total daily steps—and their sedentary behavior on a day-to-day basis. The app provides users with valuable health-related data, including daily step counts, sleep patterns, stress levels, menstrual cycle tracking, and mindfulness habits. This information empowers users to gain a deeper understanding of their current habits and make informed decisions to improve their overall well-being.

To ensure a comprehensive and structured approach, this study will follow the six phases of data analysis:

Ask – Define the problem and objectives of the analysis.
Prepare – Collect and organize the relevant data.
Process – Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Analyze – Explore the data to uncover patterns and insights.
Share – Present the findings in a clear and actionable manner.
Act – Use the insights to guide strategic decisions.
By following this framework, the analysis aims to provide meaningful insights that can help Bellabeat refine its marketing strategies and better support its users in achieving their health and wellness goals.
